Added BLM Multitoon macro system. This is designed for two mules (Named as my mules/main) to cast the same spell at the same time as the main caster. Still need to experiment with this to see how well multibinds and main send commands work.
Only the base elemental spells and elemental -ga spells are mapped (Fire, Fire II, Fire III, Fire IV, etc, Ice, Water, Firaga, Firaga II, etc)
BLM macros for enfeeble will be set up in a different manner for multibox support (Rotational binding), and AMs need to be figured out.
