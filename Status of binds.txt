Macro maps note: Most macro maps have been created. Please note, the macro maps are designed to be mapped to your job specific book in FFXI client itself, not in Windower. If you use macro changer, then put them in the proper book/page. If you do it manually, you can figure out your own place to put them. Like all of my scripts, these are my preferences. You can modify as you want/need to.

Spells: Complete
Abilities: Complete
Weaponskills: Complete

BLM - 
Main: Complete. Mapped WSes. You will need to put in the correct weapon family manually into the BLMAbilities.txt file (Staff if you want to use staff, club if you want to use club, dagger if you want to use dagger, and scythe if you want to use scythe). The WSes are on a second menu selection, since most BLMs will not use WSes except during skill ups. Please note, for staff, I did not add Earth Crusher, since there are only 10 maps, and there are 11 staff skills BLM can use with the correct SJ (And since it is basically the same as Rock Crusher). If you want it, please manually add as desired.

Mules: Created specific elemental nukes (Earth, Aero, Fire, etc) that will bind the same spells to the mules, and send the command. For example, if my main casts Fire, the key will also be bound for the mules to cast Fire. I did not bind the AM spells since I am thinking of timed rotations. For example, if my main uses Freeze, my mule 1 will hit the mob with Flare almost immediately after, to exploit the fire weakness, and the third mule will hit the mob with Flood almost immediately after to exploit the water weakness. Then, one casts, and the others follow so the spells hit 1 wait apart. But I will need to wait until my toons are lvl 60+ before I can experiment with this, and see if it is even worth it, or if I want to go with something else (Like Freeze, with the two mules following 1 wait after with Fire 4/5/6 (whatever) or Firaga 1/2/3/firaja. I will need to experiment with this.

BLU - 
Main: Mapped abilities. Created solo SCes, and shortcuts that are enterable in FFXI macro slots. These short cuts will fire off multiple character WSes, so if you do not want your main, then mule, then mule, to use these, you will need to modify. Need to think about how to set up spell maps. Might have a general reference, which can be changed easily with individual sets set up. Thinking about creating sword/club WSes that are the solo sc binds.

BRD - 
Main: Abilities and songs done. Keep in mind, you will need to increment new songs as you level up (For example, Knight's Minne is bound to I, so at level 21, just add a II to the end). WSes have been mapped. You wil need to set the weapon type in the macro map (CTRL+0).

BST - 
Main: Abilities and basic pet abilities done. WSes mapped. Not mapping pet WSes since it seems that DSP/Legion does not support Jug pet WSes. Will work on this once the Ready ability has pet WSes.
